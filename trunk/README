0. PREFACE

	The PySatel (Python-Satellite) project is devoted to building a convenient framework for easy management of constellations of multiple scientific satellites, each 
	carrying multiple different instruments.

	PySatel requires the following packages to be installed:
		o mysql
		o python, python-scipy, python-mysqldb
	PySatel requires the following Python modules to be installed:
		o ephem by pyephem project http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/
		o igrf and cxform by python-magnetosphere project https://code.google.com/p/python-magnetosphere/

1. WRITING A SATELLITE PROCESSING MODULE (SPM)

	The SPM must be a Python module conforming to the cpecial API (you can find a template telemetry file in the directory where pysatel has been downloaded)

2. USAGE

	executing from the shell
	/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pysatel/process.py

	process.py - starts main cycle for each registred satellite
		o fetching
		o saving each instrument separately
		o parsing
		o saving parsed
		o saving to database
	process.py name - starts main cycle for satellite with given name

	process.py name processBinary - it supposed that we already fetch and save binary files
	process.py name L0 is the synonym for processBinary
		o parsing
		o saving parsed
		o saving to database

	process.py name saveToTxtAndDb - it supposed that we've already parsed fetched files
	process.py name L1 is the synonym for saveToTxtAndDb
		o saving to database

	process.py name path/to/files - replenish selected satellite with the files from given directory

	Further information on using pysatel can be obtained by running

		pysatel-admin help

	Thanks for visiting.
	Supposedly someday we will build proper packages, at least for RHEL and Debian.

3. UNINSTALLATION

	ATTENTION! If you want to delete the databases with all the content too, uncomment corresponding lines

	If you want just to stop script (delete it from cron), just remove the line
		@hourly /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pysatel/process.py
	from your local crontab

	make uninstall.sh executable; run it

0. PREFACE

	The PySatel (Python-Satellite) project is devoted to building a convenient framework for easy management of constellations of multiple scientific satellites, each 
	carrying multiple different instruments.

	PySatel requires the following packages to be installed:
		o mysql
		o python, python-scipy, python-mysqldb
	PySatel requires the following Python modules to be installed:
		o ephem by pyephem project http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/
		o igrf and cxform by python-magnetosphere project https://code.google.com/p/python-magnetosphere/

1. WRITING A SATELLITE PROCESSING MODULE (SPM)

	The SPM must be a Python module conforming to the cpecial API (you can find a template telemetry file in the directory where pysatel has been downloaded)

2. USAGE

	executing from the shell
	/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pysatel/process.py
	starts the main loop

	Further information on using pysatel can be obtained by running

		pysatel-admin help

	Thanks for visiting.
	Supposedly someday we will build proper packages, at least for RHEL and Debian.

3. UNINSTALLATION

	ATTENTION! If you want to delete the databases with all the content too, uncomment corresponding lines

	If you want just to stop script (delete it from cron), just remove the line
		@hourly /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pysatel/process.py
	from your local crontab

	make uninstall.sh executable; run it
